# Act In Space 2020 - Team Phantom
Team Phantom developed a convolutional neural network based deep learning model which could predict CO, CH4, NO2, SO2, O3, NH3 and Aerosol Particle Radius in satellite images with an accuracy of over 80 percent. Further, we have developed a GUI to demonstrate our prediction results .In addition, the ML model could analyze the satellite images from the user end through GUI. The primary objective of this project is to help the relevant authorities by analyzing air quality.

This project was fundamentally aimed for the Act In Space 2020, an international space hackathon primarily organized by the National Center for Space Studies of France.
